# Write a function that reverses a string.
 # The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

# Do not allocate extra space for another array,
 # you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

# NOTE: I would find it inefficent to use anything but this. 
# A python programmer should already know that this method exists, 
# and be able to use the tools at their disposal without reinventing the wheel
