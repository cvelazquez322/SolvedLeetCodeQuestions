# Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.

# The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. 
# Null node has tilt 0.

# The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.
