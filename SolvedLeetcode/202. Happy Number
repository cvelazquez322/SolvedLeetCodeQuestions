# A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, 
# replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
# or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
# Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
